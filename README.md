# FB Chrome extension to remove the left and right sidebar, as well as some menu icons

Inspired by the blog post: https://blog.lateral.io/2016/04/create-chrome-extension-modify-websites-html-css/

Forked from: https://github.com/lateral/chrome-extension-blogpost/

## Installation

### Using "Pack extension"

Adding a packed extension is only avaialble to releases on the Chrome Web Store.
Since this is not found there, you must use the unpacked method in developer mode.

### Using "Load unpacked"

Download the source files in an accesible location.

Open Chrome and navigate to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).

On the top bar (should be on the top-right), there should be a "developer mode" that you can enable.

Once developer mode is enabled, click on the button that says "Load unpacked" to bring up a dialog.

Navigate to the folder that contains the source code and click "ok" or "select folder" to add the extension.

The extension should be loaded and now you can open up [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) to see the changes.
